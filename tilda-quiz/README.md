<h1>Tilda Quizz</h1>

<h2> ❗️ Disclaimer ❗️ </h2> 

What I wanted to do is to have two components: the dashboard displaying all available quizzes, and the quiz-question component displaying each individual question and answer options. For this, I tried to implement an injectable service to fetch data from the database and 
make it available in each of the components, but unfortunately I haven't managed to make it work in time, so I had to settle for this current setup, where I only fetch data and display everything in a single component, although I do realize that this is bad practice.
